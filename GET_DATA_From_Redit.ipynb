Bond yields are down, too, as is consumer sentiment as worries about the economic outlook mount.\\n\\n\\u201cPowell needs to give some sort of a signal that they\\u2019re watching it,\\u201d said Dominic Konstam, head of macro strategy at Mizuho Securities USA. While the Fed chief will likely make it clear that officials don\\u2019t target the stock market, they can\\u2019t ignore the recent slide, he warned.\\n\\nThe Fed is widely expected to leave interest rates steady when they meet March 18-19, but traders now see high odds of three rate cuts this year, most likely beginning in June. Economists generally expect two reductions, similar to what forecasters foresee policymakers\\u2019 updated projections to show Wednesday. \\n\\nSome investors caution that if officials continue to signal only two reductions in 2025, it becomes all the more important for the Fed chief to emphasize the central bank\\u2019s willingness to adjust borrowing costs if the labor market stumbles. \\n\\n\\u201cAt the margin, the Fed could make it slightly better or slightly worse,\\u201d said James Athey, a portfolio manager at Marlborough Investment Management. \\u201cBut clearly they can\\u2019t completely calm markets because the hit to sentiment has come largely from the White House.\\u201d \\n\\nOn top of the escalating and ever-changing tariff threats toward America\\u2019s largest trading partners, the Trump administration hasn\\u2019t done much to downplay recession risks. The president said March 9 that the US economy faces a \\u201cperiod of transition,\\u201d and his Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted the US and markets are in need of a \\u201cdetox.\\u201d \",\n          \"I'm expecting Elon's actions are going to continue to tank $TSLA and seriously diminish their vehicles' popularity and market share (hot take, I know).

Bond yields are down, too, as is consumer sentiment as worries about the economic outlook mount.\\n\\n\\u201cPowell needs to give some sort of a signal that they\\u2019re watching it,\\u201d said Dominic Konstam, head of macro strategy at Mizuho Securities USA. While the Fed chief will likely make it clear that officials don\\u2019t target the stock market, they can\\u2019t ignore the recent slide, he warned.\\n\\nThe Fed is widely expected to leave interest rates steady when they meet March 18-19, but traders now see high odds of three rate cuts this year, most likely beginning in June. Economists generally expect two reductions, similar to what forecasters foresee policymakers\\u2019 updated projections to show Wednesday. \\n\\nSome investors caution that if officials continue to signal only two reductions in 2025, it becomes all the more important for the Fed chief to emphasize the central bank\\u2019s willingness to adjust borrowing costs if the labor market stumbles. \\n\\n\\u201cAt the margin, the Fed could make it slightly better or slightly worse,\\u201d said James Athey, a portfolio manager at Marlborough Investment Management. \\u201cBut clearly they can\\u2019t completely calm markets because the hit to sentiment has come largely from the White House.\\u201d \\n\\nOn top of the escalating and ever-changing tariff threats toward America\\u2019s largest trading partners, the Trump administration hasn\\u2019t done much to downplay recession risks. The president said March 9 that the US economy faces a \\u201cperiod of transition,\\u201d and his Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted the US and markets are in need of a \\u201cdetox.\\u201d \",\n          \"I'm expecting Elon's actions are going to continue to tank $TSLA and seriously diminish their vehicles' popularity and market share (hot take, I know).
